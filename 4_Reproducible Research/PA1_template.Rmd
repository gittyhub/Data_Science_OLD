#Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

## Loading and preprocessing the data
1. Load the data.
```r
read_activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
'''
2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis
```r
NA
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```r
apply_activity<- tapply(read_activity$steps, read_activity$date, na.rm = TRUE, sum)
qplot(apply_activity, binwidth=3000,data=activity_DF, xlab = "total number of steps taken each day")
```
2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```r
#----using tapply, returns an array
#find mean
#find out how many zeros we have
table(apply_activity)[1]
#find total observation in apply_activity
length(apply_activity)
#total observation minus all zero is the number of observation we divid by
tot_observation <- length(apply_activity)-table(apply_activity)[1]
mean_steps_day<- sum(apply_activity)/tot_observation

#find median
#sort the list so that its in order
#take the tail end up until we have observations greater than zero
tail(sort(apply_activity), tot_observation)
median(tail(sort(apply_activity), tot_observation))
```r

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
