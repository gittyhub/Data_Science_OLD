#Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

## Loading and preprocessing the data
###1. Load the data.
```r
read_activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```
###2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis
```r
NA
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
###1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```r
apply_activity<- tapply(read_activity$steps, read_activity$date, na.rm = TRUE, sum)
qplot(apply_activity, binwidth=3000,data=activity_DF, xlab = "total number of steps taken each day")
```
###2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```r
#----using tapply, returns an array
#find mean
#find out how many zeros we have
table(apply_activity)[1]
#find total observation in apply_activity
length(apply_activity)
#total observation minus all zero is the number of observation we divid by
tot_observation <- length(apply_activity)-table(apply_activity)[1]
mean_steps_day<- sum(apply_activity)/tot_observation

#find median
#sort the list so that its in order
#take the tail end up until we have observations greater than zero
tail(sort(apply_activity), tot_observation)
median(tail(sort(apply_activity), tot_observation))
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

###1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```r
#Essentially, plot the same as above but instead of by date its by interval, and we are using mean not sum
apply_activity_Mean <-aggregate(steps~interval, read_activity, na.rm=TRUE, mean)
names(apply_activity_Mean)
plot( apply_activity_Mean$interval, apply_activity_Mean$steps, type="l", xlab="Mean Interval", ylab="Steps", main="Intervals and Steps")
head(apply_activity_Mean)
```

###2. Determin which position has the max steps
```r
#steps is in column 2
position <- which.max(apply_activity_Mean[,2])
apply_activity_Mean[position,]
  interval    steps
104      835 206.1698
```

###3. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
```rsum(is.na(read_activity[,1]))
#likewise
sum(is.na(read_activity$steps))
```
###4. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
