#Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

## Loading and preprocessing the data
####1. Load the data.
```r
read_activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```
###2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis
```r
NA
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
####1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```r
apply_activity<- tapply(read_activity$steps, read_activity$date, na.rm = TRUE, sum)
qplot(apply_activity, binwidth=3000,data=activity_DF, xlab = "total number of steps taken each day")
```
####2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day
```r
#----using tapply, returns an array
#find mean
#find out how many zeros we have
table(apply_activity)[1]
#find total observation in apply_activity
length(apply_activity)
#total observation minus all zero is the number of observation we divid by
tot_observation <- length(apply_activity)-table(apply_activity)[1]
mean_steps_day<- sum(apply_activity)/tot_observation

#find median
#sort the list so that its in order
#take the tail end up until we have observations greater than zero
median(tail(sort(apply_activity), tot_observation))
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
####1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```r
#Essentially, plot the same as above but instead of by date its by interval, and we are using mean not sum
apply_activity_Mean <-aggregate(steps~interval, read_activity, na.rm=TRUE, mean)
names(apply_activity_Mean)
plot( apply_activity_Mean$interval, apply_activity_Mean$steps, type="l", xlab="Mean Interval", ylab="Steps", main="Intervals and Steps")
head(apply_activity_Mean)
```

####2. Determin which position has the max steps
```r
#steps is in column 2
position <- which.max(apply_activity_Mean[,2])
apply_activity_Mean[position,]
  interval    steps
104      835 206.1698
```

## Imputing missing values
####1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)
```r
sum(is.na(read_activity[,1]))
2304
#likewise
sum(is.na(read_activity$steps))
2304

```
####2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
*Locate all na values
*Replace those na valuse with the mean of the steps minus the na's

####3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```r
#First lets reread the data
read_activity_NoNA <-read.csv("activity.csv")
#From above, locate all na values
#This gives the location, rows, where na's can be found
na_step_row <- which(is.na(read_activity_NoNA[,1]))
#Get the mean of steps
m_steps_4_na <- mean(read_activity_NoNA[,1], na.rm = TRUE)
#We now know the location of the rm, in rows, and the column we want to replace, steps, or the first column. We replace this with the mean we found
read_activity_NoNA[na_v_row, 1] <- m_steps_4_na

####4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
